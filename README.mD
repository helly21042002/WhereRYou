_Do you feel bored walking to and from your classes by yourself?_
_Or, in this hectic college life, do you find it difficult to connect with your friends?_
Don't worry, ~~we have~~ Your friends have got you covered!!!
With the help of our program, you will be able to connect with your friends on your 
college campus in a lot more effective manner.
This app will evaluate information such as a friend's schedule, location, and details about their contacts to determine a convenient time for them to connect.

It is rightly said that 
 > "If you want to walk fast, walk alone but if you want to walk far, walk together." 
Walking with a friend and sharing discussions, laughs, and rants helps us to relax and rejuvenate. 

This app keeps track of your travel schedule, such as when you leave for classes or the mess,
and if two people are going to the same place at the same time, it sends out a notification 
so that both pals can walk together to their destination. 
This breaks up the monotony of strolling and allows you to spend more time with your pals.
Rather than making hundreds of calls to your pals and asking them _"Where are you?"_ a million times,
you can simply open the app and see their journey route so you may walk and interact with them.
